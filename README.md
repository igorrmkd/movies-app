Movies search and compare application.
This is just an educational project app, that fetches omdbapi.com data, 
You search for two movies, and the app presents them in two vertical columns.
Then, it compares the movies attributes like awards, boxOffice, ratings, votes.. and chooses the winner by the numbers,
and makes the decision visible by applaying green to the winner, and yellow to the looser :)
