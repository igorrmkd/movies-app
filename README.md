Movies search and compare application,
---
As touted by Stephen Grider - in the "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course"
---
> This is just an educational project app, that fetches omdbapi.com data, and compares it.
---
> You search for two movies, and the app presents them in two vertical columns.
Then, it compares the movies attributes like awards, boxOffice, ratings, votes.. and chooses the winner by the numbers,
and makes the decision visible by applaying green to the winner, and yellow to the looser :)
